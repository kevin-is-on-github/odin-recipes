    <p>A perfectly cooked fried egg can upgrade practically anything, from avocado toast to a double cheeseburger and beyond.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp. butter, or fat of your choice</li>
        <li>large egg</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly beat the eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over low heat</li> 
        <li>Swirl to coat the bottom and sides.</li>    
        <li>Add the eggs, and cook slowly, scraping them up with a rubber spatula occasionally, until most of the liquid has thickened and the eggs are soft, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>(If you like your eggs a little firmer, cook them for an additional 2 to 3 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Remove them from the heat, and gently fold in the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. </li>   
        <li>Serve hot.</li>
